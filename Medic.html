			<h3>PROPOSAL</h3>
			<p class="projectIntro">MEDIC is a mobile application that provides our users with the tool to find nearby medical clinics and a patient history feature that allows users to input their medical history and see upcoming appointments</p>

			<h4>Project Context</h4>
			<p class="content">
				We were to research a domain to find a problem we can potentially design for. We saw an opportunity to design for healthcare because it is an industry that can potentially affect everyone, and there is little innovation and intervention right now.
			</p>

			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4>Sector Problem</h4>
			<p class="content">
				High proportion of patients may go to the local emergency department because they do not have a family doctor or cannot get a timely medical appointment.
			</p>

			<div class="businessQuote">“[Dr. Max Lebow] saw lots of people who <mark class="medicMark">'never should have been in the ER in the first place.'</mark>...20 percent of the ER patients are admitted to the hospital, which means that about 80 percent are sent home...probably 75
				percent could be <mark class="medicMark">seen in a less intensive setting</mark>”– npr, 2016</div>

			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4>Target Audience</h4>
			<p class="content">
				Through our initial user research, we were able to identified that foreign visitors are at the most disadvantaged when seeking medical help because they are not familiar with the area, and don't know where to turn to for help.
			</p>

			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4>Insights</h4>
			<span class="content">
					<span class="contentNum"> 1 &mdash; </span> Lack of transparency in the cost of healthcare.
			</span>

			<p class="insightsQuote">“Patients and consumers are now especially disadvantaged when it comes to the lack of transparency around the price and cost of healthcare products and services.” – NCBI, 2010</p>

			<span class="content">
					<span class="contentNum"> 2 &mdash; </span> 100% of physicians we interviewed said having a shared medical record can help speed up the prescription of medications and knowledge of allergies.
			</span>

			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4>Our Proposal</h4>
			<p class="content">
				We wanted to elleviate the friction of finding medical care during crucial times, so we decided to start our intervention before visitors even get sick, while they are still able to contact their health care providers. This way, they can be prepared for
				when they do in a foreign place.

			<h4>Process</h4>

			<p class="content">
				These are 3 of my initial sketches from the clinic screen to choosing a date and time. I first explored the classic calender view, but found that although it was intuitive, it was also overwhelming. I then thought about how to present only relevant information
				to the users, and came up with 2 more different sketches. The latter 2 focus on only showing the dates when at least one time is available, and going to each date would bring up the available times.
			</p>

				<p>We decided to move forward with the middle sketch because the vertical list layout allows for better scannability with room for bigger font sizes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4>Reflection</h4>
			<p class="content">
				Through researching this domain, I had a better understanding and we were able to scope the problem down to create a feasible solution. This project taught me the importance of gathering all the actors and gaining everyone's
				point of view. Our intention with Medic was to provide users with options other than the ER. While doing so, we were aware to not involve elements that we don't fully understand yet. Instead, we used empathetic research and motivational design to
				encourage users to seek medical help at clinics for less severe cases.
			</p>

			<p class="content">
				We tested our application on some designers because they were around when we were testing. However, we learned to try to test on our intended users as much as possible because the feedback the designers tend to give were more evolved around the design.
			</p>

			<p class="content">
				If we had more time, the next steps would be to explore where, when, and how users would be able to discover our application. Some thoughts are to display brochures and posters at local clinics so users are pre-exposed to the application prior to if they were to take a trip in the future.
