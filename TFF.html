			<h2 class="tffName">TRIBECA<br>FILM<br>FESTIVAL</h2>
			<p class="clientIntro">Tribeca Film Festival is a 12-day festival founded in 2002 by Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, in response to the 9/11 tragedy. Since its establishment, Tribeca Film Festival has evolved beyond just storytelling through film, into a multi-platform cultural event that includes immersive VR and games.</p>

			<h3>PROPOSAL: TRIBECA EXPLORE</h3>

			<p class="projectIntro">An addition to the existing Tribeca Film Festival application that extends the screening experience beyond the venue to explore the diverse urban establishments of Manhattan

			<h4>Business Problem</h4>
			<p class="content">From its conception, Tribeca Film Festival was only intended as a one-time event to heal the loss of vitality in the Tribeca Neighbourhood by bringing people together. However, it gained popularity but resulted in a lack of long-term vision and consistent identity that would differentiate them from other film festivals.<!--Although Tribeca Film Festival has been a frontrunner in innovative storytelling especially through non-film media and nonlinear storytelling, more established film festivals are also successfully implementing non-film projects into their programming. Simply chasing new technology and media projects is not enough to provide a unique differentiation point for Tribeca Film Festival.--></p>

			<div class="businessQuote"><i>“After more than 15 years, Tribeca <mark class="tffMark"> still seeks a consistent identity </mark> within the larger film festival ecosystem. <...> Tribeca’s timing between Sundance and Cannes limits its ability to land high-quality world premieres.”</i> – Indiewire, 2017</div>

			<h4>Opportunity</h4>

			<span class="content">
				<span class="contentNum"> 1 &mdash; </span> Tribeca Film Festival has formed a deep connection with the Tribeca neighbourhood, through its original mission to revitalize the Lower Manhattan community by exposing and supporting many local businesses and artists. 
			</span>

			<p class="content">
				<span class="contentNum"> 2 &mdash; </span> Recently, rent has skyrocketed with the gentrification of the Tribeca Neighborhood, which has resulted in a substantial change to the character of the community in which Tribeca Film Festival takes place. <!--allowing larger businesses that can afford to take over, while smaller businesses are forced to move out to other less-expensive neighborhoods. To address the festival’s lost values and inconsistency, we hope to rebuild the connection between Tribeca Film Festival and the diverse urban businesses it once helped to establish.-->

			<h4>Insights</h4>
			<span class="content">
				<span class="contentNum"> 1 &mdash; </span> There is a disconnect between the screening and the actual festival in the sense that it feels like you’re just attending a regular movie. You line up to get in, watch the film, then move on.
			</span>

			<p class="insightsQuote">“I’ve attended a few VIFF screenings, but my experiences were just as if you were going to the movies.”</p>

			<p class="insightsQuote" style="text-align: right">– Vancouver Film Festival attendee</p><br>

			<span class="content">
				<span class="contentNum"> 2 &mdash; </span> The penetration of affluent businesses into the Manhattan neighbourhood has inflated its value to give bigger companies the competitive advantage to sustain their businesses. While smaller local establishments are forced to move to less-expensive areas. </p>
			</span>

			<span class="content">
				<span class="contentNum"> 3 &mdash; </span> The once apart of Tribeca Film Festival’s Tribeca Family Festival was discontinued in 2017. Which took away with it the opportunity for local businesses to showcase themselves and establish a meaningful connection with the community. </p>
			</span>

			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4>Target Audience</h4><br>
			<p class="content">From our research, we were able to identify that film festival goers who are not cinephils would want to explore the area the festival is set in. However, there is currently no support that provides them with local information during the festival. We saw an opportunity in building a stronger relationship between Tribeca Film Festival and the local businesses by targeting casual film goers during the pre-event stage.</p>

				<h4>Reflection</h4>
				<p class="content">
					This being my first UX/UI project, I learned the importance of incorporating insights to inform our final solution. I experienced the constraints of working within a brand's guidelines and values. I also developed an interest in designing interfaces and their microinteractions. 
				</p>

				<p class="content">
					If I were to take this further, I would be interested to improve on the UI and interactions between pages to further reflect who Tribeca Film Festival is and what they have to offer.
